# User-Detection-Analysis

Get ready to explore online shopping like never before with our exciting User Behavior Analysis Project! This fun and insightful project digs into how people shop online using a cool dataset from Kaggle, called the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset, with 500 user entries. It looks at things like how long people stay on a website, what pages they visit, whether they buy something, and if they leave quickly. The project cleans up messy data, adds new details like time spent per page, and makes numbers easy to compare. Then, it creates awesome charts—like colorful heatmaps, boxplots, and scatterplots—to show patterns, such as how returning visitors spend more time or which regions shop the most. Plus, there’s a sleek bar chart comparing purchases by new and returning users. Built with simple Python tools like pandas and seaborn, this project is a fun way to uncover shopping trends and make sense of user behavior, perfect for anyone curious about data!
